# What is Binary Search ??

Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.
This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer.

In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.

Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.

> **Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items. If the elements are not sorted already, we need to sort them first.**

# Binary Search Working

Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in two ways which are discussed below.

**1-Iterative Method**

**2-Recursive Method**

The general steps for both methods are discussed below.

1- The array in which searching is to be performed is:

Let  **x=4**  be the element to be searched.

2- Set two pointers low and high at the lowest and the highest positions respectively.

3- Find the middle element ```mid``` of the array ie. ```(arr[low + high]) / 2 = 6```.

4 - If x == mid, then return mid.Else, compare the element to be searched with m.

5- If ```x > mid```, compare ```x``` with the middle element of the elements on the right side of ```mid```. This is done by setting ```low``` to ```low = mid + 1```.

6 - Else, compare ```x``` with the middle element of the elements on the left side of ```mid```. This is done by setting ```high``` to ```high = mid - 1```.

7- Repeat steps 3 to 6 until low meets high.

8 - ```x=4``` is found

### **One more Example:**

**Initial Array**

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_0.jpg">

First, we shall determine half of the array by using this formula âˆ’

```
mid = low + (high - low) / 2
```
Here it is, 0 + (9 - 0 ) / 2 = 4 (integer value of 4.5). So, 4 is the mid of the array.

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_1.jpg">

Now we compare the value stored at location 4, with the value being searched, i.e. 31. We find that the value at location 4 is 27, which is not a match. As the value is greater than 27 and we have a sorted array, so we also know that the target value must be in the upper portion of the array.

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_2.jpg">

We change our low to mid + 1 and find the new mid value again.

```
low = mid + 1
mid = low + (high - low) / 2
```
Our new mid is 7 now. We compare the value stored at location 7 with our target value 31.

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_3.jpg">


The value stored at location 7 is not a match, rather it is more than what we are looking for. So, the value must be in the lower part from this location.

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_4.jpg">

Hence, we calculate the mid again. This time it is 5.

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_5.jpg">

We compare the value stored at location 5 with our target value. We find that it is a match.

We conclude that the target value 31 is stored at location 5.

# Algorithm

**1.Iteration Method:**

```
do until the pointers low and high meet each other.
    mid = (low + high)/2
    if (x == arr[mid])
        return mid
    else if (x > A[mid]) // x is on the right side
        low = mid + 1
    else                       // x is on the left side
        high = mid - 1
```

**2. Recursive Method:**

```
binarySearch(arr, x, low, high)
    if low > high
        return False 
    else
        mid = (low + high) / 2 
        if x == arr[mid]
            return mid
        else if x < data[mid]        // x is on the right side
            return binarySearch(arr, x, mid + 1, high)
        else                               // x is on the right side
            return binarySearch(arr, x, low, mid - 1)
```
