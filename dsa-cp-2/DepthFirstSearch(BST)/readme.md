## What is Depth First Search?
#### Well, Depth First Search, also known as DFS is a way to traverse the Binary Search Tree or a graph. The fundamental idea of DFS lies within its name. We search the depth first.
#### For example, consider the below image.

#### Suppose we start from Node A. First we will go to its left, so we meet node B. Now we go to the left of B and meet Node E. Now we go to left of Node E and meet no one so we return to Node E. Now we go to the right of Node E and meet no one and return back. We are done exploring Node E so we return back to B. Now we move on to the right of B and meet Node F. We do the same with Node F ie first go right and then left and return back to B. Now we have explored Node B completely so we return back to A. Now we go to the next child of Node A i.e Node C. We go to the left of Node C and find Node F. But Node F is already visited once so we will come back again without printing it. We go to the right of C and find no one so we return. We are done exploring C so we return back to A. We do the exact same process for Node D and return back to Node A in the end.
#### So as you can notice we are exploring the depth of a particular node first. We go deeper and deeper in one direction of the node and visit all the nodes in this fashion. DFS is an efficient way of traversing a tree and it can be performed by writing a recursive code. The code has been attatched in the code file.
