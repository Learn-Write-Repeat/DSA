# Maximum and minimum of an array using minimum number of comparisons

 - Here I have created a structure named **Pair** (which contains min and max) and  ***arr*** is the array elements  and ***n*** is the size of array.I have used a method called **Comparison in Pairs**  ie,
 - If n is odd then initialize min and max as first element. 
 - If n is even then initialize min and max as minimum and maximum of the first two elements respectively. 
- For rest of the elements, pick them in pairs and compare their maximum and minimum with max and min respectively.
