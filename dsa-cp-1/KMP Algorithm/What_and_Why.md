## What Is KMP Algorithm?

KMP or Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is used for pattern searching. Pattern searching is one of the important problems in computer science. Pattern searching algorithm is used when we search for a string in notepad/word or any other text applications.
For example: 
Given an text txt[0....n-1] and a pattern pat[0...m-1], then print all the occurances of pat[] in the txt[]. Here n>m

Example
```
Input:  txt[] = "THIS IS A TEST TEXT"
        pat[] = "TEST"
Output: Pattern found at index 10
```
