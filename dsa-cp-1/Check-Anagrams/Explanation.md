### Check whether two strings are anagram of each other üôá

<<<<<<< HEAD
-   Lets first understand what are anagrams. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters in another word or phrase, such as spar, formed from rasp.

-   In this problem we will check whether the strings which are given is anagram of each other or not.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Method

‚ñ∂Ô∏è First sort the given strings
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Then compare the strings if they are same then return true or else fasle
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Time complexity : O(nlogn)
```

```c++

bool checkAnagram(string s1, string s2)
{
    // If length of both strings is not same, then they
    // cannot be anagram
    if (s1.length() != s2.length())
        return false;

    // Sort both the strings
    sort(s1.begin(), s1.end());
    sort(s2.begin(), s2.end());

    // Compare sorted strings
    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
        if (s1[i] != s2[i])
            return false;

    return true;
}
```

```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Method

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Create a hashmap mapping char to int.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Store the characters count of string 1 in the hashmap.
<<<<<<< HEAD
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Now subtract the character count of string 2 from hashmap, If the count of the character becomes less than 0 that means that character is occurring more number of times in string 2.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Therefore the two strings are not anagrams of each other return false.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Time complexity : O(n)
