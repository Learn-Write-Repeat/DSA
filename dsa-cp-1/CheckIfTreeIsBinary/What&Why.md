# What is Binary Tree?
Program to check if **binary tree is binary**. Given a binary tree, we need to check if its binary.  
A binary search tree (BST) is a node based binary tree data structure which has the following properties.  
â€¢ The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the nodeâ€™s key.  
â€¢ The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the nodeâ€™s key.  
â€¢ Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.  
From the above properties it naturally follows that:  
â€¢ Each node (item in the tree) has a distinct key.  

## Why Binary Tree?
Binary trees are used in Huffman coding, which are used as a compression code. Binary trees are used in Binary search trees, which are useful for maintaining records of data without much extra space.
