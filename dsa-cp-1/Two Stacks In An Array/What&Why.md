# What is Two Stacks In An Array?
Program to implement **two stacks in an array**. We need to create a data structure **twoStacks** that represents two stacks. Implementation of twoStacks should use only one array, i.e., both stacks should use the same array for storing elements. Following functions must be supported by twoStacks.
***push1(int x)â€“>pushes x to first stack***, ***push2(int x)â€“>pushes x to second stack***
***pop1()â€“>pops an element from first stack and return the popped element***, ***pop2()â€“>pops an element from second stack and return the popped element***.
Implementation of twoStack should be space efficient. 
## Why Two Stacks In An Array?
***When a stack is created using single array, we can not able to store large amount of data, thus this problem is rectified using more than one stack in the same array of sufficient array.***
