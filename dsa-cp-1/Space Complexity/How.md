# How to calculate Space Complexity of an Algorithm?
### Example 1:
#include<stdio.h>\
int main()\
{\
  int a = 5, b = 5, c;\
  c = a + b;\
  printf("%d", c);\
}
#### Output :

**Explanation:** In the above program, 3 integer variables are used. The size of the integer data type is 2 or 4 bytes which depends on the compiler. Now, lets assume the size as 4 bytes. So, the total space occupied by the above-given program is 4 * 3 = 12 bytes. Since no additional variables are used, no extra space is required. Hence, **space complexity for the above-given program is O(1), or constant.**
### Example 2:
#include <stdio.h>\
int main()\
{\
  int n, i, sum = 0;\
  scanf("%d", &n);\
  int arr[n];\
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++)\
  {\
    scanf("%d", &arr[i]);\
    sum = sum + arr[i];\
  }\
  printf("%d", sum);\
}
