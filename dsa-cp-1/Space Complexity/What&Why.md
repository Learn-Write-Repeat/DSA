# What is Space Complexity?
**Space complexity** is a function describing the amount of memory (space) an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm. We often speak of **extra memory** needed, not counting the memory needed to store the input itself. Again, we use natural units to measure this. Space complexity is sometimes ignored because the space used is minimal and/or obvious, however sometimes it becomes as important issue as time complexity.

## Why Space Complexity?
Space complexity also plays a crucial role in determining the **efficiency** of an algorithm/program. If an algorithm takes up a lot of time, you can still wait, run/execute it to get the desired output. But, if a program takes up a lot of memory space, the compiler will **not** let you run it.

It is the **total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program including the space of input values for execution**. So to find space complexity, it is enough to calculate the space occupied by the variables used in an algorithm/program. But often, people confuse **Space complexity** with **Auxiliary space**. Auxiliary space is just a temporary or extra space and it is not the same as space complexity. 
In simpler terms,
***Space Complexity = Auxiliary space + Space use by input values***

Important Note: **The best algorithm/program should have the lease space complexity. The lesser the space used, the faster it executes.**
